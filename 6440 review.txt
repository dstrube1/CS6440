As far as difficulty, this course was a delight. The workload was relatively light and easy. However, as far as learning anything, no I didn't learn much of anything except that medical software is a mess. That's about it.

No knowledge of AI was required or taught in this class. The fact that this could be a requirement of an Interactive Intelligence specialization seems like a bit of a scam.
