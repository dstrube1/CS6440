# mHealthTap
## Demo / mockup app for CS 6440 (Intro to Health Informatics) Practicum

This is a Xamarin based mobile application (with optional web application aspect) for Team mHealthTap's Practicum project.

This was the inital mobile app that was going to be fleshed out for our final delivery, but upon the advisement and guidance of our internal mentor Abhishek Khowala, Team mHealthTap pivoted away from this project and toward a web application that was built off of Angular, NodeJS, and Typescript.
